# echo
Echo is a 2D Physics library written in Haxe.

It focuses on maintaining a simple API that is easy to integrate into any engine/framework (Heaps, OpenFL, Kha, etc). All Echo needs is an update loop and its ready to go!

Try the Samples [here](https://austineast.github.io/echo)!

## Features
* Semi-implicit euler integration physics
* SAT-powered collision detection
* Quadtree for broadphase collision querying
* Collision listeners to provide collision callbacks
* Extendable debug drawing

## Getting Started

Echo requires [Haxe 4](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.0.0-rc.1/) to run.

Install the library from haxelib:
```
haxelib install echo
```
Alternatively the library can be installed from github:
```
haxelib git echo https://github.com/AustinEast/echo.git
```

Then include the library in your project's `.hxml`:
```
-lib echo
```
For OpenFL users, add this into your `Project.xml` instead:

```
<haxelib name="echo" />
```

## Usage

### Concepts

#### Echo

The `Echo` Class holds helpful utility methods to help streamline the creation and management of Physics Simulations. It is recommended import this class like so: 
```
using echo.Echo;
```

#### World

A `World` is an Object representing the state of a Physics simulation and it configurations. 

#### Bodies

A `Body` is an Object representing a Physical Body in a `World`. A `Body` has a position, velocity, mass, an optional collider shape, and many other properties that are used in a `World` simulation.

#### Shapes

A Body's collider are represented by different Shapes. Available Shapes:
* Rectangle
* Circle
* Capsule (Coming Soon)
* Polygon (Coming Soon)

#### Groups

Groups are collections of Bodys. These can be used for grouping collisions.

#### Listeners

Listeners keep track of collisions between Bodies and Groups, enacting callbacks and physics responses, depending on their configurations.

### Example
```haxe
// `using` echo.Echo is prefered over importing it, as it adds in some useful extension methods
using echo.Echo;

class Main {
  static function main() {

    // Create a World to hold all the Physics Bodies
    // Worlds, Bodies, and Listeners are all created with optional configuration objects.
    // This makes it easy to construct object configurations, reuse them, and even easily load them from JSON!
    var world = Echo.start({
      width: 64, // Affects the bounds for collision checks.
      height: 64, // Affects the bounds for collision checks.
      gravity_y: 5, // Force of Gravity on the Y axis. Also available for the X axis.
      iterations: 2 // Sets the number of iterations each time the World steps.
    });

    // Create a Body with a Circle Collider and add it to the World
    world.make({
      shape: {
        type: CIRCLE,
        radius: 16
      }
    });

    // Create a Body with a Rectangle collider and add it to the World
    // This Body will have a Mass of zero, rendering it as unmovable
    // This is useful for things like platforms or walls.
    world.make({
      mass: 0, // Setting this to zero makes the body unmovable by forces and collisions
      y: 48, // Set the object's Y position below the Circle, so that gravity makes them collide
      shape: {
        type: RECT,
        width: 10,
        height: 10
      }
    });

    // Create a basic listener.
    // Calling this with no parameters will cause every object to collide against one another
    world.listen();

    // Set up a Timer to act as an update loop
    new haxe.Timer(16).run = () -> {
      // Step the World's Physics Simulation forward
      world.step(16 / 1000);
      // Log the World State in the Console
      echo.util.Debug.log(world);
    }
  }
}

```
